We implemented all the Node JS parts, even though they are not going to be graded. The node server is running. If for
some reason it stops running it can be ran again using the command "node /var/www/html/js/app.js "

We used ejs (embedded Javascript) files for all the node views to combine html and backend javascript.

Part 1: We used the corresponding date() function for every language to display current time. Random background color
is generated using a random number generator from 0 to 2 and assign a color for each number.

Part 2: All languages have a variable consisting of all the environment variables.

Part 3: Each part of our form has a field name that can be used in the backend to retrieve their values from the post
request. The last dropdown menu chooses which of the 3 languages (Perl, PHP, JS) is used to display the user's info. Our
frontend script is located at js/main.js.

Part 4: Part 4 has two session pages. Session1 (page 1) asks for the user's name and stores it into a session using PHP session or Perl CGI session. Afterwards, session 2 grabs this data from the same session and displays it on the page with the user's information. If the user did not add any information in Session1, then in Session2 it will display a different text to the user, telling the user to go to Session1 to input their name. On Session2, the user can also press the button to clear session data.
