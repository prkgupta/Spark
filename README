For Homework #3 we used MySQL and NodeJS in order to display a list of movie
data in our website.
Link to our homepage : http://198.199.116.102
Click on the last button to go to our movie list, or use the url below
Link to our movie list: http://198.199.116.102:8000/movies

If for any reason server stopped working it can easily be run again with the command "node /var/www/html/js/app.js"

We used a few npm packages including:
express: to serve http requests
mysql: for database manipulation
bodyparser: helper package that used to be part of express
ejs: to interact with our template files (.ejs)

We used restful routes to create, read, update and destroy data.
/movies             GET     View
/movies/new         GET     New
/movies             POST    Create
/movies/:id/edit    GET     Edit
/movies/:id         PUT     Update
/movies/:id         DELETE  Destroy

On front end we used twitter bootstrap for a nice presentation of the data. Using the bootstrap grid system, everything
is completely responsive, mobile friendly, and adjusted and lined up based on the display size.

Pagination support:
On the bottom of the list, you can search through the various movies. 
This is done using JavaScript to limit the amount of rows displayed on each
page.

How to sort:
Sort the columns by clicking the top headers (such as title, year) and it will
automatically sort in ascending or decending order. It is done using jQuery with
a function called tablesort. 

How to add:
Click the buttom on the bottom left side of the page named "Add Record" which
will bring you to a form to add a new movie into our database.

How to edit:
Click the "Update" button of the movie you want to edit.

How to delete:
Click the "Delete" button to delete the movie. You will be prompted before
deleting the movie.
