For Homework #3 we used MySQL and NodeJS in order to display a list of movie
data in our website. Link to our movie list: http://198.199.116.102:8000/movies  
Pagination support:
On the bottom of the list, you can search through the various movies. 
This is done using JavaScript to limit the amount of rows displayed on each
page.

How to sort:
Sort the columns by clicking the top headers (such as title, year) and it will
automatically sort in ascending or decending order. It is done using jQuery with
a function called tablesort. 

How to add:
Click the buttom on the bottom left side of the page named "Add Record" which
will bring you to a form to add a new movie into our database.

How to edit:
Click the "Update" button of the movie you want to edit.

How to delete:
Click the "Delete" button to delete the movie. You will be prompted before
deleting the movie.
